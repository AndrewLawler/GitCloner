# Git Cloner
I often code most of my work on my Laptop and i'm then forced to test on my University system. The process of finding what my repo is called and then opening cmd to then have to re type the same line over and over to clone many repositories was a lot. This was something i then wanted to solve.
## How does this work?
Simply clone the repo manually(i know, funny.) and then lanch the GUI to input your GitHub name and your Repository name. The program will then clone the repo directly into the folder you have Git Cloner in.

# Git Script
Fed up of writing 'git add .' 'git commit -m "text"' and 'git push' instead just use this simply GUI which can do everything for you!
## How does this work? 
Simply type 'java GitScriptGUI and click the button.
